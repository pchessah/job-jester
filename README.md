# Angular App Challenge: Job Listing and Filtering

## Task Description:

Build a job listing application using Angular 17 that showcases job listings and allows users to filter and search for jobs based on various criteria. The app should have the following features:

### Design with Bootstrap:
- Utilize Bootstrap for responsive design and layout of the application. Ensure it looks visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Job Listing Display:
- Fetch and display job listings from a mock API or static data (such as JSON files).
- Display job title, company name, location, and a brief description for each job.

### Filtering and Sorting:
- Implement filters for users to refine job searches based on criteria such as job title, location, company name, and job type (full-time, part-time, remote).
- Allow users to sort job listings based on relevance, date posted, or job type.

### State Management:
- Implement a state management solution (e.g., NgRx, Angular Services, RxJS BehaviorSubject) to manage the application's state efficiently.

### Services and API Integration:
- Create services to handle data retrieval from a mock API or static data sources.
- Mimic API calls using Observables or Promises to simulate fetching job data.

### Additional Functionality:
- Implement pagination for the job listings.
- Include a search bar for users to search for specific keywords within job listings.
